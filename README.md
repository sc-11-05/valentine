This was a small project I put together for my girlfriend, something I really hoped she would enjoy and feel touched by. I didn’t have much time—only about four hours left to work on it—so I couldn’t make it as elaborate or polished as I originally imagined. Even so, I poured everything I could into it, trying to make it meaningful in the time I had. It may not be grand, but it’s sincere, and I hope that comes through when she sees it.
